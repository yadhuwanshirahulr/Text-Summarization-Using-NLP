# Text-Summarization-Using-NLP


**Project Start Date:** [June,2023]

**Project End Date:** [July,2023]


## Description

Automatic text summarization is basically summarizing of the given paragraph using natural language processing and machine learning. There has been an explosion in the amount of text data from a variety of sources. This volume of text is an invaluable source of information and knowledge which needs to be effectively summarized to be useful.

Here are some significant reasons why we need text summarization-
• Text summarization shortens reading time.
• Automatic summarization improves the effectiveness of searching, i.e., it speeds up searching for necessary information among vast quantities of data.
• The text summarization technique boosts the volume of data stored in a particular space.
• Human summarizers are more biased and inaccurate than automatic summarizing techniques.
• Business providers can enhance the volume of texts they can handle by using automatic or semi-automatic summarizing systems.
